					I’ve struggled countless times to take the first step on a new path. Whether that was a new
					direction in
					my career, a side project, a new relationship. Typically it’s the big things that prove
					insurmountable.
					There’s a yearning inside to start but the path and sometimes the end isn’t clear at all. Between
					that
					deep yearning stands a thick impenetrable fog. A fog swirling with a nasty concoction of fears: fear
					of
					failure, fear of humiliation, fear of choosing wrong, fear of wasted time. A fog, which in my
					personal
					experience, only thickens over time as I naively realise the strand of rope left in my lifetime
					doesn’t
					in fact stretch out to infinity. The usual response is either paralysis or exhaustion from running
					endless mental simulations in a desperate attempt to clutch at certainty. I’ve demonstrated all
					these
					patterns of behaviour — innumerable times. I’m still doing it now even, as I take this break from
					work
					to figure out my next play. Slowly though, I’ve come to realise a simple truth. The fog never fully
					disappears. So the only way is to proceed through it.
					<br><br>
					There are two books in particular that sit by my side constantly and have been a tremendous source
					of
					encouragement. ‘Starting Point’, which is a collection of essays from Hayao Miyazaki, and Insisting
					on
					the Impossible, a biography of Edwin Land. From Miyazaki, I have come to learn that great things can
					start with nothing more than a spark of desire. It’s enough to take the first step with just that
					yearning I previously described. In the essay series “From Idea to Film” he advises up and coming
					animators on starting and says “if the shape is amorphous, you can start with a vague yearning…a
					certain
					sentiment, a slight sliver of emotion — whatever it is”. He goes on to reassure them that all the
					details don’t have to be known — “it is fine if, at times, the original starting point of a
					full-length
					feature film is the image of a girl tilting her head to the side…it doesn’t matter if the story
					isn’t
					yet complete. The story will follow. Later still the characters will take shape.” Meticulously
					mapping
					out the steps from idea to final product seems to be just a surefire way to fall victim to analysis
					paralysis. Sometimes faith is needed and I think this is what Steve Jobs meant when he said, you
					can’t
					connect the dots going forward.
					<br><br>
					Once you’ve started though, how do you finish? We all know too well that finishing is in many ways
					just
					as hard as beginning. From what I can tell, it seems to boil down to: accept there will inevitably
					be
					bumps in the road, take it one step at a time, and have faith ambiguity will resolve itself through
					the
					work. Working in this way takes humility and persistence. Miyazaki says “At times, your work may be
					rejected entirely. When I mentioned earlier that you must have the will to go to any length, this is
					what I meant. When you draw that first picture, it is only the beginning of an immense journey”.
					<br><br>
					Surprisingly Edwin Land is not that well known from my experience, but he is the inventor of instant
					photography and the Polaroid camera. The idea for instant photography came to Land via an innocent
					question from his daughter, “why can’t I see the picture right away?”. Taken aback, he took a long
					walk
					to ponder this. He describes the moment as follows: “I went for a walk haunted by my daughter’s
					question. And during the course of that walk, the question kept coming up. Why not? Why not make a
					camera that gave a picture right away? … Strangely, by the end of that walk, the solution to the
					problem
					had been pretty well formulated. I would say that everything had been, except those few details that
					took from 1943 to 1973.” The point here is that it took him 30 years to figure it out and no amount
					of
					planning could have resolved all the hurdles he was to face. The way he proceeded was just one
					single
					step at a time “it is a wonderful dream even though the end is a long way off, for there are about
					five
					thousand steps to be taken before we realize it. and start taking the first ten, and stay making
					twenty
					after, it is amazing how quickly you get through those five thousand steps.“ Miyazaki also
					encourages us
					not get bogged down in the salvo of ambiguities that will crop up during the process. You have to
					embrace uncertainty and move forward by doing the work. “what kind of world, serious or comedic;
					what
					degree of distortion; what setting; what climate; what content; what period; whether there is one
					sun or
					three; what kinds of characters will appear; what is the main theme? …The answers to all these
					questions
					gradually become clearer as you continue to draw….Draw as many pictures as you can.” Eventually,
					“you
					keep on coming nearer to giving the world something worth having.”
					<br><br>
					What’s become increasingly obvious to me is that certainty is an illusion. Everyone who starts and
					finishes seems to have developed a tolerance for ambiguity. It’s difficult to wrestle with because
					there’s no guarantee of success either to reward this effort and Miyazaki states it bluntly to the
					aspiring animators “it holds no guarantees in terms of pay or time”. How will you know though
					without
					venturing forth? The only guarantee seems to be that the journey will transform you. And perhaps,
					that
					is all we can ask for.
					<br><br>
					How do you manage the challenges of beginning and ending?
