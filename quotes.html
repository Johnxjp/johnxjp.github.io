                    Let us not wait for other people to come to us and call upon us to do great deeds.
                    Let us instead be the first to summon the rest to the path of honor. 
                    Show yourself to be the bravest of all the captains, 
                    with more of a right to leadership than those who are our leaders at present.

                    If you know the enemy and know
					yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you
					know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will
					also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you
					will succumb in every battle.

                    Don’t act as if you were going to live 10,000 years. Death hangs over
					us all. Whilst you’re alive, while it is in your power, be good.

                    It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.
